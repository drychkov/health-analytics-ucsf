## Week 5 - GraphX

For week 5, we can no longer use Python as GraphX is not supported by PySpark. We need to shift to Scala. Luckily, we can do so from the Jupyter Notebook we have been using.

After logging onto your Vagrant box using ```Vagrant shh```, please enter the following command before launching your Jupyter notebook:

```jupyter toree install --spark_home=/usr/local/spark --user```
